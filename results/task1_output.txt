/Users/Cyberkid/.matplotlib is not a writable directory
Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /var/folders/nc/j0_qb68d56n41c1cs268md0r0000gn/T/matplotlib-t2qhvdkx because there was an issue with the default path (/Users/Cyberkid/.matplotlib); it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Matplotlib is building the font cache; this may take a moment.
